# TOR SOCKS Proxy Docker

To run a TOR SOCKS proxy server in docker, one can either build the image following the guide below OR pull the image directly from [UNIC-IFF Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/uniciff/repositories).

## Pulling the docker image from the Dockerhub.

```
docker pull uniciff/tor_socks_proxy
```

## Building the TOR SOCK proxy image
To build the docker image for TOR socks, run the following.

```
chmod +x ./build_containers.sh
./build_container.sh
```

## Running the TOR SOCKS proxy in a local container

```
docker run -d --rm --name tor-socks-proxy -p 9050:9050 uniciff/tor_socks_proxy
```

It will start the TOR SOCKS PROXY and it listens to new connections on port 9050.

Alternatively, one can include use it as a service in a *docker-compose.yaml* file. Just add a similar to the following service entry:

```YAML
version : "3.2"

services:
  tor_socks_proxy:
    image: uniciff/tor_socks_proxy
    container_name: tor_socks_proxy
    restart: unless-stopped
    expose:
      - "9050"
    networks:
      - local-tor-exposed-net

  other_service:
    image: alpine
    networks:
      - local-tor-exposed-net

networks:
  local-tor-exposed-net
```
